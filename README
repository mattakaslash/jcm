| History |
-----------

The original DnD 4e Combat Manager exists as a VB.NET project at
http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/DnD4eCM. It was originally written by a user
named Mortaneus. When he gave up maintenance of the application, he posted the
source code as a ZIP file. Using that ZIP file, I made modifications and
additions and eventually ported my fork of the application to Java, which
resulted in this code.

---------

This program generates files alongside itself. The files are as follows:
 - cm.properties (application settings)
 - statlibrary.dnd4 (an XML file storing statblock information)
 - statlibrary.dnd4.bak (a temporary backup of the stat library)
 - statlibrary.dnd4.saved.bak (a saved backup copy of the stat library,
                               created if the temporary backup was not removed)
                               
This version will read a statlibrary.dnd4 generated by the VB.NET version of
the application; however, EffectBase Durations are stored differently and will
result in a statlibrary.dnd4 that is not backwards-compatible with the VB.NET
application.
